# Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind

**Yuval Noah Harari's exploration of our species.**

## The Cognitive Revolution
70,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens started doing something very special: talking about things that do not exist. Myths, legends, gods, religions. 

> "You can never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven."

This ability to create **fictions** allowed us to cooperate in large numbers.

## The Agricultural Revolution
12,000 years ago, we stopped wandering and started farming. We thought we tamed the wheat, but actually, **wheat tamed us**. We worked harder, had worse diets, and disease spread. It was history's biggest fraud.

## The Scientific Revolution
500 years ago, we admitted we didn't know everything. The discovery of **ignorance** triggered the most rapid expansion of power in history. Science and Empire married, and the world was unified.
