# The Three-Body Problem

**Liu Cixin's masterpiece that redefined sci-fi.**

## The Physics of Despair service
In the Trisolaran world, there is no pattern. Three suns dance in a chaotic ballet, bringing unpredictable eras of "Chaos" and "Order". Civilizations are destroyed and reborn in an endless cycle.

> "Physics has never existed, and will never exist."

This is the ultimate expression of the **Three-Body Problem**: a deterministic system that exhibits chaotic behavior, making long-term prediction impossible.

## Cosmic Sociology
If the universe is full of life, why is it so silent?

1. Survival is the primary need of civilization.
2. Civilization continuously grows and expands, but the total matter in the universe remains constant.

This leads to the **Dark Forest** theory: Every civilization is an armed hunter stalking through the trees like a ghost... If he finds other life—another hunter, an angel, or a devil, an infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod—there's only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them.

## The Dimensional Strike
The ultimate weapon is not a bomb, but a law of physics. Reducing the universe from three dimensions to two. A beautiful, flat painting of death.
