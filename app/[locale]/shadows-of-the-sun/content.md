# The Shadow of the Sun

## The Beginning: Collision

Only the sun is certain here. 

We arrived in Africa not as discoverers, but as collisions. The white man in Africa is a being apart, an alien body, an artificial element. He is protected by his technology, his medicine, his money. But strip those away, and he is helpless before the continent.

But the African? The African has made a pact with the heat.

## The Anatomy of a Coup

In the early mornings, the radio plays martial music. That is how you know power has shifted.

A coup in Africa is not a revolution. It is often simply a changing of the guard, a redistribution of privileges among the elite. The soldiers come from the barracks, seize the radio station, the palace, the airport. The people wait. They watch from the shadows of their verandas. They know that whoever rules, the sun will still burn them tomorrow.

Power here is not abstract. It is physical. It is the ability to command shade, to command water, to command life. To be in power is to be in the cool; to be powerless is to be left in the glare.

## The Sun

The sun in Africa is not the romantic sun of European holidays. It is a despot. It rules every hour of the day.

At dawn, it is a sudden explosion of light. There is no twilight, no gentle transition. One moment it is night, the next the world is ablaze.

By noon, it is a white tyrant. It silences the birds, stops the work, drives every living thing into hiding. The world holds its breath. Under this sun, thought becomes difficult, movement becomes pain. It is a biological weight that presses down on the skull.

The only relief is the shadow. In the shadow, life returns. Conversations happen, deals are struck, rest is taken. The shadow is the only true home in this landscape. To describe Africa, one must describe its shadows.
